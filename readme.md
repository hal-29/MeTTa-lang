   - length, is-member, append, max-value, min-value, push , pop , remove-element , remove-duplicate , map , filter , foldl , foldr , reverse , sort
   
   [Implementation code ]('./list.metta')
## 3, How can OpenCog Hyperon be the framework for Artificial General Intelligence?
 <details>
   <summary>Answer:</summary>
   OpenCog Hyperon can serve as a framework for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) by combining multiple cognitive architectures and learning models, enabling autonomous, flexible, and adaptive reasoning. It integrates symbolic and subsymbolic methods, such as logic, probabilistic reasoning, and deep learning, to mimic human-like thought processes, allowing AGI systems to generalize knowledge, learn from experience, and make complex decisions across diverse domains.
